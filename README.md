# SQL-Database
For our Project, we created a database for the organization Whole Food Markets Where we constructed tables, loaded data into them and created queries for the tables in our database using MYSQL. Whole Foods Market is a natural supermarket chain, it has 500 stoes in North America and the company employs roughly, 95,000 people. For the purpose of this project we only created 9 tables in Total
Our goal for our database is to track customers purchase history. Is to see what products sells the most and which product need to be placed different in the store. That people see it more so they will buy it. Also able to track how the Whole Food sales are doing and if they are need improving.
